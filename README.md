# honestly-wow-notifier

What is this for? Imagine you're already logged in to the game and you want to stay online but... you need to go AFK. Fire up your remote desktop tool, fire up this script and receive notification when you're booted to character selection or main login screen. No more checking your phone every 10 minutes.

1. Make sure that your game Display Mode is set to `Windowed` and Window Size is `2560x1440`. Your game window must be on your primary screen if you have more than one.
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (you can do this with `pip` by invoking `pip install -r requirements.txt`). Usage of virtual environment is recommended. Python 3.9+ is required.
3. Run the script, for list of all available options refer to script's help (`python main.py --help`)
